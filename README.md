Assignments

Create a Task Tracker web app for a team in an organization using React. 
A task will have following properties : 
Title
Description
Start Date (this date will be same as task created date)
End date (only present in tasks marked as Completed)
Status (possible status states are)
Pending
In Progress
Completed
Deployed
Deferred
Assignee (task owner)
Priority (P0 / P1 / P2 )
	Each task status should have a column of its own. We should be able to sort the tasks by Priority and start date / end date.
	We should be able to Filter tasks based on Date range (task created date from and to range) / Assignee / Priority. We should be able to apply these filters in multiple combinations for eg, filter tasks which are assigned to John Doe(Assignee) that are of P1 priority.
Note - 
Web Page should be responsive. Use your creativity to design the web application.
A user should be able to add/delete tasks. (Completed tasks cannot be deleted)
